    <h1>Welcome to <a href="https://microsub.jamesg.blog" class="u-url p-name">James' Microsub Endpoint</a>!</h1>
    <p>This Microsub endpoint is run by {{ config.ME }}.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">This site lets you read and manage your web feed subscriptions (for approved users only).</p>
    <h2>What is Microsub?</h2>
    <p>Microsub is a draft standard specification that separates the roll of a feed reader and a feed server. Using the Microsub standard, feed readers and servers can be developed independently. This means that users get more choice in terms of the application that they use to look at their feeds.</p>
    <p>James, the creator of this tool, uses this server to subscribe to and manage his feeds. He used to use clients such as Monocle (web) and Indigenous (iOS) to monitor his feeds. He recently implemented his own client on this server that he can use to read his feeds.</p>
    <h2>How can I learn more about Micropub?</h2>
    <p>The IndieWeb wiki contains the information you'll need to have about Micropub to get started. The official editor's draft of the specification is also available on the IndieWeb wiki.</p>
    <p>Some useful resources to look at are the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">Microsub</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Clients">Microsub Clients</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Servers">Microsub Servers</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec">Microsub Specification</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Can I host my own Micropub client and server?</h2>
    <p>Yes! You can host your own Microsub endpoint. This client and server is open-sourced so you can use this one if you would like. This is the ideal configuration if you choose to use a static generator like Jekyll on your site.
        You can deploy a version of this Micropub client and server by going to <a href="https://github.com/capjamesg/microsub">the project GitHub page</a> and following the instructions.</p>
    <p>You can find other Micropub clients and servers on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">IndieWeb wiki</a>.</p>
