    <h1>Welcome to <a href="https://microsub.jamesg.blog" class="u-url p-name">Cinnamon</a>!</h1>
    <p>Cinnamon is a social reader and server run by {{ config.ME }}.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">This site lets you read and manage your social web subscriptions (for approved users only).</p>
    <h2>What is Microsub?</h2>
    <p>Microsub is a draft standard specification that separates the roll of a social reader and server. Using the Microsub standard, social readers and servers can be developed independently. This means that users get more choice in terms of the application that they use to look at the content they follow.</p>
    <p>James, the creator of this tool, uses this server to subscribe to and manage the blogs and people he follows. He used to use clients such as Monocle (web) and Indigenous (iOS) to follow websites. He recently implemented his own client on this server that he can use to read content from the authors he follows.</p>
    <h2>How can I learn more about Microsub?</h2>
    <p>The IndieWeb wiki contains the information you'll need to have about Microsub to get started. The official editor's draft of the specification is also available on the IndieWeb wiki.</p>
    <p>Some useful resources to look at are the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">Microsub</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Clients">Microsub Clients</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Servers">Microsub Servers</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec">Microsub Specification</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Can I host my own Microsub client and server?</h2>
    <p>Yes! You can host your own Microsub endpoint. This client and server is open-sourced so you can use this one if you would like. This is the ideal configuration if you choose to use a static generator like Jekyll on your site.
        You can deploy a version of this Microsub client and server by going to <a href="https://github.com/capjamesg/microsub">the project GitHub page</a> and following the instructions.</p>
    <p>You can find other Microsub clients and servers on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Microsub">IndieWeb wiki</a>.</p>
